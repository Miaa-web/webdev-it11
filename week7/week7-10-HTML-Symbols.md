# HTML Symbols



## HTML Symbol Entities

HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.

To add these symbols to an HTML page, you can use an HTML entity name.

If no entity name exists, you can use an entity number; a decimal (or hexadecimal) reference.



***Take Note*** 

If you use an HTML entity name or a hexadecimal number, the character will always display correctly.
This is independent of what character set (encoding) your page uses!

```html
<p>I will display &euro;</p>
<p>I will display &#8364;</p>
<p>I will display &#x20AC;</p>
```

Will display as:

​	I will display €
​	I will display €
​	I will display €
