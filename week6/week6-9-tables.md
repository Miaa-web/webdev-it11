# Background Images

use the HTML `style` attribute and the CSS `background-image` property:

### Example:

```html
<body style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg')">
```



## Background Repeat

If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element



## remember

To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the `background-repeat` property to `no-repeat`.



## Background Cover

If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the `background-size` property to `cover.`
