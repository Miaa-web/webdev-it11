# Image Maps

An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more `<area>` tags.



### Shape

You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

- `rect` - defines a rectangular region
- `circle` - defines a circular region
- `poly` - defines a polygonal region
- `default` - defines the entire region



## summary

- Use the HTML `<map>` element to define an image map
- Use the HTML `<area>` element to define the clickable areas in the image map
- Use the HTML `usemap` attribute of the `<img>` element to point to an image map
